# Ray Tracer

This project is a ray tracing program written in C++ that dynamically generates scenes with random spheres, lighting, and camera positions. It demonstrates the fundamentals of ray tracing, including reflections, transparency, and procedural shading.

## Features

- **Scene Generation**: Randomized placement of spheres, light sources, and camera positions for unique outputs every time the program is executed.
- **Reflections and Transparency**: Support for reflective and transparent surfaces.
- **Procedural Shading**: Basic procedural shading techniques for realistic rendering.
- **Anti-Aliasing (Optional)**: Smooth edges through jittered ray directions.

## How It Works

The program uses a simple ray tracing algorithm to simulate the interaction of light rays with objects in a 3D scene. The scene is dynamically generated by:

1. Placing a ground plane.
2. Adding randomized spheres with varying positions, sizes, colors, reflectivity, and transparency.
3. Adding a light source with random intensity and position.

The output is saved as a `.ppm` image file.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
- A text editor or IDE to view/edit the code (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion).

### Steps

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/prcsh14/dynamic-ray-tracer.git
    cd dynamic-ray-tracer
    ```

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
    ```
    g++ -o raytracer main.cpp
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```
    ./raytracer
    ```

4. The output image will be saved as `output.ppm` in the same directory.

5. Open the `.ppm` file using an image viewer that supports PPM format (e.g., GIMP, IrfanView) or convert it to another format like PNG using ImageMagick:
    ```
    convert output.ppm output.png
    ```

## Example Output

Here’s an example of what the rendered image might look like:

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: Core programming language used for implementing the ray tracer.
- **Math Libraries**: Basic vector math for 3D calculations.
- **PPM Format**: Simple image format used for output.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more complex materials (e.g., metallic surfaces).
- Implement advanced lighting techniques like global illumination.
- Add support for textures and bump mapping.
- Include multi-threading for faster rendering.
